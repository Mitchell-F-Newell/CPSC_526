Enroll is a simple program that takes in a username and password and does a few things:

1) Ensures that the username does not already exist in the .txt userprofile file.

2) ensures that the password is secure and not just a number, or a dictionary
word, or a number followed by a dictionary word, or a dictionary word followed by a number
(i.e., [word], [num], [wordnum], and [numword] all forbidden).

2) Uses the Argon2 hashing algorithm and a salt to hash the password securely.

3) Adds the user profile (username and hashed password) to the DB (In this case jsut a simple .txt file)
